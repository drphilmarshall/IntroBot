IntroBot
========

Introducing people who have common interests, on Twitter.

To make a whole lot of Twitter introductions at once, IntroBot just needs a plain text datafile listing your community's Twitter users, and some text describing their interests. IntroBot parses this text, pairs people up, and introduces them, gracefully. 

## Getting started
